### 德國 UFZ 環境研究中心 [Hydrological and river water quality modelling](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=40077)
  - We conduct a close coupling of **on-line** water quality monitoring and associated water quality **modelling**. New high temporal resolution monitoring techniques offer improved opportunities to analyse flow path and associated matter transport.
  - [Smart Models / Monitoring](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=43277): Smart models and monitoring allow complex environmental systems to be analysed and reliable predictions to be made about how environmental systems will react to anthropogenic disturbance.
