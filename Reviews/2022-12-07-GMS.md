**GSFLOW** (Linux/Win) Version 1.2.1, 2016/10/01
*Coupled Groundwater and Surface-water FLOW model* based on the USGS *Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System* (**PRMS**) and *Modular Groundwater Flow Model* (**MODFLOW**-2005)

### USEPA desc

- **GFLOW** is an analytic element model, which solves steady state groundwater flow in a single aquifer. 
- **GFLOW** supports three-dimensional particle tracking, but employs the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation, thereby ignoring resistance to vertical flow. 
- **GFLOW** features a "**MODFLOW** extract" feature that allows a complete set of **MODFLOW** files to be written for a subdomain of the model. All aquifer properties and hydrological features are automatically duplicated in the **MODFLOW** files.
- Additional features: 
  - Areas of differing aquifer properties,
  - horizontal barriers with resistance to flow (slurry walls),
  - 3D flow near a partially penetrating well,
  - local transient flow near a well (Theis solution),
  - steady state interface flow in coastal aquifers, and
  - **PEST** support for parameter optimalization.
- **GFLOW** supports both vector and raster graphics as background maps, including DXF, Shapefile, TIFF, JPG.

The EPA WhAEM analytic element model is similar in many ways (single layer analytic element model) but has a simplified user interface optimized for wellhead protection (capture zone delineation).

### compilation

- macOS gfortran need additional options of `-w -fallow-argument-mismatch -O2`
