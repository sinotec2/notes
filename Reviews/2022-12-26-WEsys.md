- EBARA incinerators completely incinerate waste at high temperatures to minimize the release of hazardous substances into the environment. At the same time, steam recovered from the incineration heat is used for power generation and other purposes.

- To date, EBARA has used CFD simulations to develop incinerators that can provide stable incineration of waste regardless of the type or shape of the waste. Thanks to significant improvements in computer performance in recent years, it is now possible to use new simulation technologies such as particle simulation.
