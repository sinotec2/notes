## SIMBA
### 原創公司
- [ifak](https://www.ifak.eu/en/produkte/simba)
  - SIMBA#, the simulation system for innovative model-based solution concepts for a multitude of applications in the water, wastewater and biogas sectors, has reached a new milestone!
  - The new version SIMBA# 5.0 takes the modelling of sewage treatment plants, sewer networks, rivers and pressure-pipe systems to a new level. 
  - The release notes list the most important innovations. 
  - In particular, the immission-based consideration of water quality with discharges from sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants is now made considerably easier. 
  - For this purpose, SIMBA# provides a "multi-solver" simulation environment with which several sewer networks (hydrodynamic), river sections, pressure pipe networks and treatment plants can be simulated in parallel, each with specific solution algorithms. The project representation is now alternatively also possible in a geographically referenced bird’s eye view.

### Features
- To compare and verify design alternatives for new treatment plants
  - Evaluate the performance of a WWTP through pre-defined and custom indicators under dynamic conditions. 
  - Compare design alternatives with respect to effluent quality, investment and operational costs. 
  - Run multiple simulations automatically, identify optimal design and verify performance under various boundary conditions using the Advanced Experiments tool (Uncertainty Analysis, Sensitivity Analysis, Scenario Analysis and Parameter Estimation).
- To optimise and upgrade existing treatment plants
  - Develop and calibrate detailed dynamic process models as virtual replicas of existing systems and processes. 
  - Identify optimal operational strategies and test possible process configurations virtually. 
  - Instruct staff and plant operators of optimal setpoints for control or to evaluate the efficacy of a new process. 
  - Implement plant-wide models by integrating multiple layers (water line, sludge line, energy, control) to holistically evaluate and optimise plant operations. 
  - Facilitate the transition from treatment plants to resource recovery facilities.
- To develop custom process models and new processes blocks
  - Access the WEST library using a Gujer Matrix Editor or a conventional Code Editor, and develop custom models that include non-standard processes and components.
  - Create new process unit blocks and incorporate custom models using a dedicated Block Editor. 
  - Virtually test the performance of a new biological treatment process which incorporates unique hydraulic characteristics and operating stages. 
  - Develop a new model block with its input, hydraulic properties and biokinetic conversion processes (in addition to the standard **IWA's Activated Sludge Models**).
- To implement advanced control strategies of unlimited complexity
  - Evaluate various operational strategies with flexible control models, prior to their implementation. Automatically convert Matlab fuzzy logic controllers. 
  - Build fully customisable control systems using multiple control blocks. 
  - Easily navigate the model library and customise control blocks to fit plant-specific nuances in operation and control using the built-in Model Editor. 
  - Benefit from built-in templates as well as inline syntax check and error detection, code snippets and code verification.
- To run complex, integrated models on one software platform
  - Perform long-term and complex simulations of integrated systems including catchments, collection systems and recipients (watersheds, rivers) in a less computationally intensive manner. 
  - Incorporate a variety of sensors and controllers to allow for real-time simulation and process optimisation at a system-wide scale.
- To calculate the carbon footprint of your WWTP and achieve more sustainable operations
  - WWTPs are known to produce large amounts of greenhouse gases (e.g. N2O). 
  - WEST users can accurately track a variety of greenhouse gas sources, both direct and indirect, using state-of-the-art models.Compare operational strategies based on carbon footprint and identify the most effective sustainability solution.

    - Activated sludge no. 1 (ASM1), developed by the international association on water quality (IWAQ, 1987) task group, is one of them, and it has been widely used in industry and research to model the biological treatment process of activated sludge systems (Henze et al., 1987). 
    - Activated sludge no. 2 (ASM2) was developed to include the process of removing phosphorus compounds and organic carbon from sewage, nitrification, and denitrification (Gujer et al., 1995). 
    - ASM2D enhanced ASM2 by integrating two additional processes that describe polyphosphate accumulation in anoxic conditions (Henze et al., 1999). 
    - Activated sludge no. 3 (ASM3) was designed to overcome some of the limitations of ASM1 and describes the storage of organic substrates (Henze et al., 2000, Gujer et al., 1999).
    - Anaerobic digestion model no. 1 (ADM1) has been broadly used to simulate anaerobic digestion biochemical and physicochemical processes ([Batstone et al., 2002]).
