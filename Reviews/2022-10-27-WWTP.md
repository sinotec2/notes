## SIMBA
### 原創公司
- [ifak](https://www.ifak.eu/en/produkte/simba)
  - SIMBA#, the simulation system for innovative model-based solution concepts for a multitude of applications in the water, wastewater and biogas sectors, has reached a new milestone!
  - The new version SIMBA# 5.0 takes the modelling of sewage treatment plants, sewer networks, rivers and pressure-pipe systems to a new level. 
  - The release notes list the most important innovations. 
  - In particular, the immission-based consideration of water quality with discharges from sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants is now made considerably easier. 
  - For this purpose, SIMBA# provides a "multi-solver" simulation environment with which several sewer networks (hydrodynamic), river sections, pressure pipe networks and treatment plants can be simulated in parallel, each with specific solution algorithms. The project representation is now alternatively also possible in a geographically referenced bird’s eye view.

    - Activated sludge no. 1 (ASM1), developed by the international association on water quality (IWAQ, 1987) task group, is one of them, and it has been widely used in industry and research to model the biological treatment process of activated sludge systems (Henze et al., 1987). 
    - Activated sludge no. 2 (ASM2) was developed to include the process of removing phosphorus compounds and organic carbon from sewage, nitrification, and denitrification (Gujer et al., 1995). 
    - ASM2D enhanced ASM2 by integrating two additional processes that describe polyphosphate accumulation in anoxic conditions (Henze et al., 1999). 
    - Activated sludge no. 3 (ASM3) was designed to overcome some of the limitations of ASM1 and describes the storage of organic substrates (Henze et al., 2000, Gujer et al., 1999).
    - Anaerobic digestion model no. 1 (ADM1) has been broadly used to simulate anaerobic digestion biochemical and physicochemical processes ([Batstone et al., 2002]).
