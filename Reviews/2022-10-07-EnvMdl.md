Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, Environmental Change Assessment 36:116–125. doi:10.1016/j.cosust.2018.11.004.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187734351830023X)

Challenges associated with integration of the existing modelling approaches We identified four main challenges (Figure 2): first, inconsistencies in modelling approaches, second, differences in sources of river pollution, third, differences in pollutant behavior in river systems and fourth, computational (IT) barriers depending on the spatial and temporal resolution.

Existing modelling approaches differ in how the processes controlling export of pollutants to rivers and sea are modelled. Some models lump processes, while other are more detailed. Lumped models use rather simple parameter-based approaches to quantify retentions and losses of pollutants in river systems, and often focus on the integration of sources of pollution and possible solutions. They are typically on an annual temporal basis, ignore heterogeneity within a river basin, however, can be easily used for scenario analyses to explore solutions. Examples are the integrated global or continental models for nutrients (Global [NEWS-2][30], [MARINA][62]), [triclosan][8] and microplastics [17•]. Another type are the distributed, process-based models. Such models more explicitly account for the terrestrial water cycle and substance flows within a river basin. Modelling of processes controlling retentions and losses of pollutants in soils and rivers is typically more complex in distributed than in lumped models, and often account for inter-annual dynamics. Distributed models often run at grid scale (e.g. 0.5° cell). However, data needs and computation time are generally higher. Examples are gridded models for nutrients (IMAGE-GNM [11], WorldQual [2••,38•]), microorganisms (WorldQual [2••,39•] and for pathogens GLoWPa [5•,23]), water temperature (RBM [63,64], WorldQual [65]), biological oxygen demand and salinity (WorldQual [2••,39•]).


For a global, integrated multi-pollutant model, we may start with a rather pragmatic way of integrating existing modelling approaches. This requires changes in existing modelling approaches (e.g. adding new or re-calibration of existing parameters). We argue for a first multi-pollutant model to be in-between lumped and process-based, and to include important sources of different pollutants and their behavior in river systems for scenario analyses.

Existing global models differ in the sources of pollutants that are accounted for (see Section ‘Introduction’, Figure 1). But there are also similarities. This relates to the fact that some pollutants have common sources. For example, pollutants from personal care products (e.g. triclosan [8•] and microplastics [17•]) are discharged in rivers through sewage systems (point source), that also transport pathogens and nutrients from households. Meanwhile, manure use on land is also a source of pathogens and nutrients (diffuse source). The existing modelling differ in how they approach point and diffuse sources, making integration possible, but also a challenge (see example in Section ‘Scientific challenges for global multi-pollutant modelling’ and Figure 3).
